<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Charisse Marie Corrales, a web developer passionate about building clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites. 
  With expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
  I focus on crafting visually appealing and functional web experiences that enhance usability and engagement.</p>

<p>I love turning ideas into reality through code, whether it's designing sleek layouts, improving interactivity, 
  or ensuring seamless responsiveness across devices. 
  I'm always eager to learn and stay updated with the latest web trends to refine my skills.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, you'll find me trekking, crafting, or acting, 
  all of which fuel my creativity and problem-solving mindset. Let's collaborate and bring great ideas to life!</p>
